# How to contribute to Agora UIKit

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Flutter-UIKit/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Flutter-UIKit/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Ensure that the patch compiles and runs on iOS, and Android.

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Agora UIKit will generally not be accepted.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the form of a Feature Request Issue on this repository.

* One of the team at Agora will respond to your issue, and together we can figure out whether this feature is applicable to be added to Agora UIKit.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use UIKit on the [RTE Dev Slack](https://www.agora.io/en/join-slack/).
